# A place to hold my codes.
I was thinking about keeping all the stuff to myself.  But no longer.

## File structure
OOP and DM programming homework projects are stored here. For each project, both CMake files and VS-style project files are stored in the same directory. Newer and more compatible updates for earlier projects are on schedule.

## Issues
Pretty sure few would give a damn to my codes each crammed within a day or so. But if you do spot some funny mistakes, feel free to open an issue. I'd greatly appreciate that :)
